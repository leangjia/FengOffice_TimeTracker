I use FengOffice (fengoffice.com) since 2013. And I like timeslots functionality. I use them for billing my projects and for saving common info about steps in tasks.
But use this functionality very uncomfortable if you are out of office. Esspecialy if you are using only community version.
That's why I decide to make android applicaton for work with FengOffice timeslots.

I am not a professional programmer. Please don't kick me if some my solutions are wrong. But the first problem that I have met was underdone API of FengOffice. So I had to write my version of API - vatapi plugin. If you want to test my application you'll need first to instal this plugin (see it in attachment).

I start alfa-testing of my application. And I open topic for questions and errors about it: http://forum.fengoffice.com/index.php?topic=20827.0
